title: "Dynamic Scheduling Problem Python Solver with RL"
---
**Still work in progress**

This project focuses on exploring the research field of dynamic scheduling problems with RL, dealing with stochastic arrival of the new orders and tardiness cost function

Main points:
* Developed the ’Environment’ class using object-oriented programming in Python to address a dynamic scheduling problem,
enhancing system flexibility and scalability.
* Engineered a Reinforcement Learning (RL) agent complete with a customized learning algorithm to efficiently manage dynamic
scheduling of orders, accommodating random arrival times and diverse cost functions such as earliness and tardiness.
* Conducted comparative analysis of the RL agent against heuristic solutions, achieving a 10% cost reduction in scenarios utilizing
the tardiness cost function, thereby demonstrating significant performance improvements.

The final paper and code will be released soon
