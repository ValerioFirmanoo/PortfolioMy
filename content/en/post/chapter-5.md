For my Bachelor's final project in Physics, I delved into the realm of Biophysics, embarking on a research journey to develop a novel model. Focused on understanding the response of specific Ribosome characteristics to nutrient shifts, our endeavor aimed to fill a crucial gap in existing knowledge.

Through meticulous exploration, we unearthed a significant oversight in the prevailing model, which primarily addressed specific conditions rather than the broader scope. Our efforts culminated in the creation of a streamlined model that effectively encapsulated our experimental data.

The fruits of our labor were unveiled in 2023 through publication, marking a milestone in our quest for deeper insights into the intricate workings of biological systems.
