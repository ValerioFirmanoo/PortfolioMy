EduQuery is an online learning platform leverages Language Learning Models (LLMs) to create a gamified educational experience. By integrating adaptive learning algorithms, it personalizes content delivery, ensuring that each learner’s journey is unique and engaging. The platform’s interactive challenges and reward systems are designed to increase motivation and enhance retention. With a focus on collaborative learning, users can connect and compete, fostering a community of learners. The use of LLMs not only facilitates language acquisition but also encourages critical thinking and problem-solving skills, making learning both fun and impactful.
