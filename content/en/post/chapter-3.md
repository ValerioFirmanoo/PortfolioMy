The goal of this project was to write a fast and reliable library to compute the price of different Options built on stochastic-simulated stock paths, leveraging the computational power of GPUs and CUDA

Main points:
* Developed a CUDA-based library for GPU-accelerated Monte Carlo simulations, achieving over 30Ã— faster option pricing analyses
for both vanilla and exotic options compared to CPU benchmarks.
* Leverage CUDA programming and financial modeling, ensuring rapid and accurate option valuation in
high-performance computing settings.
